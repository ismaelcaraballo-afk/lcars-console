# üé§ Voice Commands Guide - AI-Powered

The LCARS AI Console features **Star Trek-style voice recognition with AI integration**. Just like in the show, all commands start with **"Computer"** followed by your instruction.

## üöÄ What Makes This Special

Unlike simple voice navigation, the LCARS voice system is **AI-powered**:
- ‚úÖ Ask **any question** - it goes to AI Chat for intelligent responses
- ‚úÖ Navigate panels with simple commands
- ‚úÖ Check weather, tasks, or any information
- ‚úÖ Natural conversation - no rigid command syntax needed!

## How to Use Voice Control

### 1. Activate Voice Recognition
Click the **microphone button** in the top-right corner of the screen (next to the clock).

When active:
- The microphone icon will glow
- A pulsing animation indicates the system is listening
- You'll hear an activation beep

### 2. Say "Computer" + Your Request
All voice commands follow this pattern:
```
Computer, [your request or question]
```

### 3. The System Responds Intelligently
- **Navigation commands** ‚Üí Opens the requested panel
- **Questions or requests** ‚Üí Opens AI Chat and automatically processes your question
- **Weather queries** ‚Üí Opens Weather Panel with current data
- A confirmation beep plays for all commands
- Toast notifications show what action was taken

- [ ] Is there background noise?
- [ ] Did you grant microphone permission?

**Try**:
1. Click microphone button again to restart
2. Speak more clearly
3. Reduce background noise
4. Check browser console for errors

- Listens continuously for "Computer"
- Ignores other speech

### Multiple Commands
You can chain actions by voice:
1. "Computer, open tasks"
2. Wait for navigation
3. "Computer, open calendar"
4. Continue navigating

### Deactivation
Click the microphone button again to stop voice recognition:
- Icon stops pulsing
- Deactivation beep plays
- System stops listening

## How the AI Integration Works

When you say a command that isn't a simple navigation request, the system:

1. **Recognizes** your voice command
2. **Analyzes** the intent - is it navigation or a question?
3. **Routes** to the appropriate handler:
   - Navigation ‚Üí Opens the panel directly
   - Question/Request ‚Üí Opens AI Chat and processes through AI
4. **Responds** with visual and audio feedback

### With Claude AI Enabled
When you add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:
- Get **powerful natural language understanding**
- Ask **complex questions** and get detailed answers
- Have **contextual conversations** about any topic
- Much smarter than basic pattern matching!

### Without API Key (Free Mode)
The system still works with built-in natural language processing:
- Handles common questions (weather, tasks, time, status)
- Provides helpful responses
- Suggests where to find information
- Works entirely offline!
